# ethereum-block-explorer

# ToDos:
- fix loading issue when changing blocks to show on main BlocList interface

# Features To Add
Junior: 
- show transaction data per block 
- add search address functionality and get info on the address
- add a search feature that smartly allows you to look up a block, a transaction, or an address and see its data
- explain with onhover popup what each piece of data means

From Project Description: 
- Allow users to click into transactions and view each transaction and its parameters on a separate page
- Make an accounts page where a user can look up their balance or someone else's balance
- Can you show whether an address is a smart contract or an externally owned address? How would you do that? Could you show the bytecode at that address?
- Allow users to change the Ethereum network their viewing (ropsten, rinkeby, local, or mainnet)
- Determine the gas price based on how much has been spent on the latest transactions. For example, you could use the average of the last 500 transactions to determine the current expected price
- Can you use the route of the website to lookup the address? For instance, if the URL was http://localhost:1234/address/0x2ec1eaca4ca25899dd3ed79b81cfbc167ed5b8a4, could you use that address?
